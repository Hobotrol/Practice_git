We all came out to Montreux
               F    Gm
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
Gm
To make records with a mobile
F          Gm
We didn't have much time
Gm
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
                   F    Gm
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
